            Social media is highly influensing the society. It has power to change the mentality of the Public. The rise of social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram has created a convenient way for people to connect. We can now personalize our online presence and meet more people.

            While social media offer tons of advantages, it also comes with a significant downside.
            
            A study in the “Journal of Depression and Anxiety” suggested a link between high social media usage and increased depression. Another research found that people who use social media are 2.7 times more likely to be depressed than those who don’t.
            
            The exact reason social media is linked with depression is up for debate. However, some possible causes include:
            <ul>
                <li>Fear of missing out</li>
                <li> Spending too much time online</li>
                <li> Cyberbullying </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
